# pearsonUserAgreementFormCreator

It would be kinda nice if the python program upon running asks the user to upload the pdf schedule, then verifies if the pdf is indeed a pearson vue schedule. Then furthermore, the program will allow the user to verify whether the user can go ahead and print all the pdfs created.
